which
was
preventing
access
the
free
spins.
love
and
hate
this
fab
game.
after
this
update:
first,
randomly
lost
all
488
levels
but
randomly
fixed
itself
(twice
now);
and
second,
randomly
got
around
8400
minutes
left
for
the
next
life
w/o
changing
the
date/time
but
luckily
fixed
itself
too.
please
fix
these
issues!
there
are
two
major
bugs
the
latest
version,
1.41.0.
first,
the
game
doesn't
terminate
when
you
press
the
back
key
(on
samsung
phone,
least);
returns
the
home
screen,
but
leaves
the
app
running
the
background,
making
have
close
using
app-killer
program
don't
want
candy
crush
saga
eating
phone's
memory
and
battery
life
when
i'm
not
playing
it.
secondly,
within
minute
opening
game,
now
causes
phone
crash
and
restart
about
50%
the
time.
with
spots
the
wheel,
should
land
jackpot
every
8th
spin
average.
it's
been
well
over
200
spins
now,
and
haven't
landed
jackpot.
this
close
mathematical
impossibility
it's
random
spin..
unless
it's
fixed?
completely
restarted,
had
reached
level
and
had
even
payed
onto
new
sections!
now
all
sudden
i'm
back
level
seriously
guys?
had
reached
level
419
and
without
any
reason
went
back

very
unstable
and
hence
uninstalling
it.
